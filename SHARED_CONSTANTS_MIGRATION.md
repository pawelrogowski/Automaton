# SharedConstants.js Migration - October 2025

## Overview

This document describes the complete removal of `electron/workers/sharedConstants.js` and the migration of all constants to the unified SAB (SharedArrayBuffer) system.

**Date Completed:** October 12, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** - All workers migrated, sharedConstants.js deleted

---

## Background

The `sharedConstants.js` file was created during the initial implementation of the legacy SAB system (before October 2024). It contained:
- Memory layout constants (buffer indices, sizes)
- Pathfinding status codes
- Data structure sizes and offsets

As of October 2024, the unified SAB system was implemented in `electron/workers/sabState/`, which provides:
- Type-safe property access via `sabInterface.get()` / `sabInterface.set()`
- Automatic versioning and atomic reads
- Schema-driven memory layout
- Zero manual index management

The `sharedConstants.js` file became redundant once all workers migrated to the unified SAB interface.

---

## What Was Removed

The following files were **deleted**:
- ✅ `electron/workers/sharedConstants.js` (140 lines)

The following constants were **previously defined** in sharedConstants.js:

### Memory Layout Constants (Now Obsolete)
These are no longer needed because the unified SAB system handles memory layout automatically:
- `PLAYER_X_INDEX`, `PLAYER_Y_INDEX`, `PLAYER_Z_INDEX`, `PLAYER_POS_UPDATE_COUNTER_INDEX`
- `PATH_LENGTH_INDEX`, `PATH_CHEBYSHEV_DISTANCE_INDEX`, `PATH_START_X_INDEX`, etc.
- `BATTLE_LIST_COUNT_INDEX`, `BATTLE_LIST_ENTRIES_START_INDEX`
- `CREATURES_COUNT_INDEX`, `CREATURES_DATA_START_INDEX`
- `TARGETING_LIST_COUNT_INDEX`, `TARGETING_LIST_DATA_START_INDEX`
- `TARGET_INSTANCE_ID_INDEX`, `TARGET_NAME_START_INDEX`
- `LOOTING_REQUIRED_INDEX`, `LOOTING_UPDATE_COUNTER_INDEX`

### Configuration Constants (Now Obsolete)
These defined buffer sizes that are now automatically calculated:
- `MAX_PATH_WAYPOINTS`, `PATH_WAYPOINT_SIZE`, `PATH_DATA_SAB_SIZE`
- `MAX_BATTLE_LIST_ENTRIES`, `BATTLE_LIST_ENTRY_SIZE`, `BATTLE_LIST_SAB_SIZE`
- `MAX_CREATURES`, `CREATURE_DATA_SIZE`, `CREATURES_SAB_SIZE`
- `MAX_TARGETING_RULES`, `TARGETING_RULE_SIZE`, `TARGETING_LIST_SAB_SIZE`
- `TARGET_SAB_SIZE`, `LOOTING_SAB_SIZE`

### Status Codes (Migrated to SAB Schema)
These were the **only constants still in use**:
- `PATH_STATUS_IDLE` (0)
- `PATH_STATUS_PATH_FOUND` (1)
- `PATH_STATUS_WAYPOINT_REACHED` (2)
- `PATH_STATUS_NO_PATH_FOUND` (3)
- `PATH_STATUS_DIFFERENT_FLOOR` (4)
- `PATH_STATUS_ERROR` (5)
- `PATH_STATUS_NO_VALID_START_OR_END` (6)
- `PATH_STATUS_BLOCKED_BY_CREATURE` (7)

---

## What Was Changed

### 1. Added PATH_STATUS Constants to Unified SAB Schema

**File:** `electron/workers/sabState/schema.js`

**Added:**
```javascript
// Pathfinder status codes (used in pathData.status, cavebotPathData.status, targetingPathData.status)
export const PATH_STATUS = {
  IDLE: 0,
  PATH_FOUND: 1,
  WAYPOINT_REACHED: 2,
  NO_PATH_FOUND: 3,
  DIFFERENT_FLOOR: 4,
  ERROR: 5,
  NO_VALID_START_OR_END: 6,
  BLOCKED_BY_CREATURE: 7,
};

// Legacy named exports for backward compatibility
export const PATH_STATUS_IDLE = PATH_STATUS.IDLE;
export const PATH_STATUS_PATH_FOUND = PATH_STATUS.PATH_FOUND;
export const PATH_STATUS_WAYPOINT_REACHED = PATH_STATUS.WAYPOINT_REACHED;
export const PATH_STATUS_NO_PATH_FOUND = PATH_STATUS.NO_PATH_FOUND;
export const PATH_STATUS_DIFFERENT_FLOOR = PATH_STATUS.DIFFERENT_FLOOR;
export const PATH_STATUS_ERROR = PATH_STATUS.ERROR;
export const PATH_STATUS_NO_VALID_START_OR_END = PATH_STATUS.NO_VALID_START_OR_END;
export const PATH_STATUS_BLOCKED_BY_CREATURE = PATH_STATUS.BLOCKED_BY_CREATURE;
```

### 2. Updated Import Statements in Workers

All workers that previously imported from `sharedConstants.js` now import from `sabState/schema.js`:

| File | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| `cavebot/helpers/communication.js` | `import { PATH_STATUS_IDLE } from '../../sharedConstants.js'` | `import { PATH_STATUS_IDLE } from '../../sabState/schema.js'` |
| `cavebot/fsm.js` | `import { PATH_STATUS_* } from '../sharedConstants.js'` | `import { PATH_STATUS_* } from '../sabState/schema.js'` |
| `cavebot/helpers/navigation.js` | `import { PATH_STATUS_IDLE } from '../../sharedConstants.js'` | `import { PATH_STATUS_IDLE } from '../../sabState/schema.js'` |
| `targetingWorker.js` | `import { PATH_STATUS_IDLE } from './sharedConstants.js'` | `import { PATH_STATUS_IDLE } from './sabState/schema.js'` |
| `pathfinder/logic.js` | `import { PATH_STATUS_* } from '../sharedConstants.js'` | `import { PATH_STATUS_* } from '../sabState/schema.js'` |
| `movementUtils/confirmationHelpers.js` | Removed unused imports entirely | No sharedConstants imports |

### 3. Files Changed

**Total files modified:** 6
- ✅ `electron/workers/sabState/schema.js` (added constants)
- ✅ `electron/workers/cavebot/helpers/communication.js`
- ✅ `electron/workers/cavebot/fsm.js`
- ✅ `electron/workers/cavebot/helpers/navigation.js`
- ✅ `electron/workers/movementUtils/confirmationHelpers.js`
- ✅ `electron/workers/targetingWorker.js`
- ✅ `electron/workers/pathfinder/logic.js`

**Total files deleted:** 1
- ✅ `electron/workers/sharedConstants.js`

---

## Verification

### Import Check
```bash
# Check for any remaining imports of sharedConstants (should only find bug.txt)
grep -r "sharedConstants" electron/workers/
```

**Result:** Only `electron/workers/bug.txt` references sharedConstants (legacy file, no impact)

### Worker Functionality
All workers continue to function correctly because:
1. ✅ PATH_STATUS constants are identical values (0-7)
2. ✅ All workers already use unified SAB interface for data access
3. ✅ No manual buffer index calculations remain in any worker

---

## Benefits of This Migration

### 1. **Single Source of Truth**
All constants are now defined in `sabState/schema.js`, eliminating confusion about where to find definitions.

### 2. **Consistency**
Constants used in SAB are now defined in the same file as the SAB schema itself.

### 3. **Maintainability**
- Adding new status codes: Edit one file (`schema.js`)
- Adding new SAB properties: Schema-driven, no manual index management
- Refactoring workers: Clear import path (`sabState/schema.js`)

### 4. **Type Safety**
The unified SAB system provides type-safe access, eliminating the risk of:
- Off-by-one errors in buffer indices
- Torn reads from concurrent writes
- Mismatched buffer sizes

### 5. **Developer Experience**
New developers no longer need to understand:
- Raw SharedArrayBuffer indexing
- Manual versioning schemes
- Buffer size calculations

They can simply use:
```javascript
sabInterface.get('propertyName')  // Read
sabInterface.set('propertyName', value)  // Write
```

## Migration Guide for Future Development

### Adding New Status Codes
**Before (sharedConstants.js approach):**
```javascript
// Would need to add to sharedConstants.js
export const MY_NEW_STATUS = 8;

// Then manually ensure it's used correctly everywhere
```

**After (unified SAB approach):**
```javascript
// Add to sabState/schema.js
export const PATH_STATUS = {
  IDLE: 0,
  PATH_FOUND: 1,
  // ... existing statuses ...
  MY_NEW_STATUS: 8,  // Add here
};

// Named export for backward compatibility
export const PATH_STATUS_MY_NEW_STATUS = PATH_STATUS.MY_NEW_STATUS;
```

### Adding New SAB Properties
**Before (sharedConstants.js approach):**
```javascript
// Would need to manually calculate offsets
export const MY_DATA_INDEX = 1234;
export const MY_DATA_SIZE = 56;
```

**After (unified SAB approach):**
```javascript
// Add to SCHEMA in sabState/schema.js
myNewProperty: {
  category: PROPERTY_CATEGORIES.REALTIME,
  type: 'struct',
  fields: {
    value: FIELD_TYPES.INT32,
    version: FIELD_TYPES.INT32,
  },
  size: 2,
  description: 'My new property',
}
// Layout calculation is automatic!
```

### Accessing SAB Data
**Before (sharedConstants.js approach):**
```javascript
import { PLAYER_X_INDEX } from './sharedConstants.js';
const playerX = new Int32Array(playerPosSAB)[PLAYER_X_INDEX];
```

**After (unified SAB approach):**
```javascript
const { data } = sabInterface.get('playerPos');
const playerX = data.x;
```

## Summary

✅ **sharedConstants.js has been completely removed**  
✅ **All PATH_STATUS constants migrated to sabState/schema.js**  
✅ **All workers updated to import from unified SAB schema**
