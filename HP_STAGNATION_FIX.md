# HP Stagnation Bug Fix

## Problem Description
The game had a visual bug where the bot would get stuck targeting a creature whose HP value wasn't changing. This occurred due to game rendering issues where the bot would attack a target but the HP bar would not update visually, causing the bot to continuously attack without realizing the creature's HP was stuck.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Missing Configuration**: The HP stagnation detection relied on `workerState.globalState?.targeting?.hpStagnationDetection` configuration that was never initialized in the Redux store, causing the feature to be disabled by default.

2. **Premature Reset of Adjacent Tracking**: The `hasBeenAdjacent` flag was being reset immediately when the player moved away from the target, even briefly. This could interrupt HP stagnation detection during normal combat movement.

3. **Insufficient Escape Handling**: After sending the escape key, the state wasn't being properly cleared, which could cause the bot to immediately re-acquire the same stuck target without properly resetting the visual state.

## Changes Made

### 1. `electron/workers/targetingWorker.js`

#### Improved HP Stagnation Detection Function
- Added **fallback default configuration** so the feature works even when not explicitly configured
- Implemented **delayed reset** for `hasBeenAdjacent` flag (2-second grace period) to prevent premature resets during normal combat
- Added `notAdjacentSince` timestamp tracking to implement the delayed reset
- Enhanced **escape handling** to explicitly clear both `currentTarget` and `pathfindingTarget`
- Improved **logging** with more descriptive messages showing HP values and target names
- Added proper initialization when first becoming adjacent to a target

#### Updated State Management
- Added `notAdjacentSince` field to `hpStagnationDetection` tracking object
- Ensured consistent reset of all HP stagnation fields across state transitions

### 2. `frontend/redux/slices/targetingSlice.js`

#### Added HP Stagnation Configuration to Store
- Added `hpStagnationDetection` configuration to initial state with sensible defaults:
  - `enabled: true` - Feature enabled by default
  - `checkInterval: 500` - Check HP every 500ms
  - `stagnantTimeoutMs: 4000` - Trigger escape after 4 seconds of HP stagnation
  
- Added `updateHpStagnationConfig` action to allow runtime configuration changes
- Exported the new action for use by UI components

## How It Works Now

1. **When engaging a target**: HP tracking initializes when entering ENGAGING state
2. **When adjacent**: Marks `hasBeenAdjacent = true` and starts tracking HP value
3. **When not adjacent temporarily**: Keeps tracking for 2 seconds before resetting (handles brief movement)
4. **Every 500ms** (configurable): Checks if HP has changed
5. **After 4 seconds** (configurable) of HP stagnation while adjacent:
   - Logs warning with target name and HP value
   - Sends Escape key (keyCode 27) to untarget
   - Explicitly clears `currentTarget` and `pathfindingTarget`
   - Resets all HP stagnation tracking
   - Transitions to SELECTING state to retarget
6. **Retargeting**: Bot can now select a new target or properly reacquire the same one

## Configuration

Users can configure the HP stagnation detection by dispatching the `updateHpStagnationConfig` action:

```javascript
dispatch(updateHpStagnationConfig({
  enabled: true,
  checkInterval: 500,      // milliseconds between HP checks
  stagnantTimeoutMs: 4000  // milliseconds before triggering escape
}));
```

## Benefits

- **Fixes the visual bug**: Automatically detects and recovers from stuck HP scenarios
- **Enabled by default**: Works out of the box without user configuration
- **Configurable**: Users can adjust timing if needed
- **Robust tracking**: Handles temporary movements without false positives
- **Better logging**: Clear messages about when and why escaping occurs
- **Clean state management**: Proper cleanup prevents re-acquiring stuck targets

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with creatures that trigger the visual bug
2. Verify escape key is sent after ~4 seconds of HP stagnation
3. Confirm bot retargets properly after escape
4. Check that normal combat (with brief movements) doesn't trigger false escapes
5. Verify configuration changes take effect at runtime
