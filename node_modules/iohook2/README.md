# iohook2
Nodejs bindings for libuiohook, and a replacement/renewal to the abandoned iohook library (and at least 5 other alternatives that have also been abandoned!)

Install with `npm install iohook2`

# About
This package allows your nodejs program to read keyboard and mouse events on a global scope, even if the user isn't focused in the console window!

### You can check for the following events:
- keypress *[TODO: Needs fixing. Use keydown/keyup]*
- keydown
- keyup
- mouseclick
- mousedown
- mouseup
- mousemove
- mousedrag
- mousewheel

## Example
```
const io = require('iohook2');

io.on('keydown', e => {
    console.log(e.key+" pressed!");
});
io.on('keyup', e => {
    console.log(e.key+" released!");
});

io.start();
```

## Build Requirements
- Windows: VS2015
- MAC: Clang
- Linux: GCC

### Linux
**The following packages are required:** git cmake pkg-config libx11-dev libxtst-dev libxt-dev libxinerama-dev libx11-xcb-dev libxkbcommon-dev libxkbcommon-x11-dev libxkbfile-dev

### Windows
Please install [cmake](https://cmake.org/download). Any required DLLs should be pre-installed.

*Note: Windows support is WIP. Code compiles with no errors but then has a strange linker issue.*

### Mac
*Macs cost money and (for personal reasons I won't get into, not to mention the right-to-repair stuff) Apple isn't getting any more of mine. But if you have one please do help out getting it to work! Shouldn't be too different from Linux, just different dependencies.*

## Detailed Usage
All key events provide a `key` property with the key name as a String, as well as a `code` property with the raw keycode. The recognized special keys are as follows:
- backspace
- esc
- tab
- enter
- capsLock
- leftShift / rightShift
- leftCtrl / rightCtrl
- leftAlt / rightAlt
- leftMeta / rightMeta
- mediaPlay / mediaStop / mediaBack / mediaNext
- up / down / right / left
- pageUp / pageDown
- insert / delete
- home / end
- brightUp / brightDown
- printScr
- pauseBreak
- numLock
- f1 -> f12

Additionally, the following boolean properties are available in any key event to check if a *modifier key* is being held:
- capsLock
- leftShift / rightShift / shift
- leftCtrl / rightCtrl / ctrl
- leftAlt / rightAlt / alt
- leftMeta / rightMeta / meta

### TODO:
- scrollLock (SCROLL LOCK BUTTON IS ANGY, CAN'T GET CODE)
- Test mediaStop (I don't have a stop button. It's kinda redundant isn't it?)
- volumeUp/Down/Mute (Yeah I don't have an excuse for this one besides lazy)
- Number Pad Buttons (Could be of use to many programs, but I don't have a numberpad on hand, will have to dig one out somewhere. Or hacksaw one off the neighbor's keyboard they won't notice)

- Document on('event'), start(), pause(), resume(), stop()
