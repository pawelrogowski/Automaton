# BattleList Implementation Summary

## âœ… Successfully Implemented

### 1. RegionDefinitions.js Updated

- **Added** 20 individual battle entry slots (entry0-entry19)
- **Precise positioning** based on exact measurements:
  - Entry list starts: 2px right, 13px down from battleList top-left
  - Each entry: 20Ã—20px with 22px spacing (20px + 2px gap)
  - Entry list ends: 17px left, 5px up from battleList bottom-right

### 2. Complete Entry Structure

Each entry now includes:

- **targetBorder**: [255,0,0] detection at (0,0) - indicates currently targeted monster
- **attackBorder**: [0,0,0] detection at (1,1) - indicates monster targeting player
- **nameText**: 131Ã—12px OCR region at (22,2) for monster names
- **healthBar**: 132Ã—5px region at (22,15) with validation and health calculation areas

### 3. BattleListSequences.js Updated

- **Added** precise color sequences for border detection
- **Added** health bar validation sequences
- **Maintained** backward compatibility with legacy sequences

### 4. Usage Pattern

The system now provides:

```
regions.battleList.children.entriesRegion.children.entry0.targetBorder
regions.battleList.children.entriesRegion.children.entry0.attackBorder
regions.battleList.children.entriesRegion.children.entry0.nameText
regions.battleList.children.entriesRegion.children.entry0.healthBar.validationPixel
regions.battleList.children.entriesRegion.children.entry0.healthBar.healthArea
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Ready for Testing

The implementation is complete and ready for testing with actual game screenshots. The system will automatically determine how many entries are visible based on the calculated height of the entriesRegion.

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

1. Test with actual game screenshots
2. Verify positioning accuracy
3. Implement health percentage calculation logic using the 130Ã—3px healthArea
4. Add OCR processing for monster names
