# Creature Instance ID Stability Fix - 2025-10-08

## Problem

The targeting system was still switching targets randomly, but the root cause was actually in the **creatureMonitor**, not the targeting logic. The creatureMonitor was assigning new instance IDs to the same creature, causing the targeting worker to think the creature died and a new one appeared.

## Root Cause

The creatureMonitor was creating new instance IDs for existing creatures due to:

1. **Too strict OCR name validation** - Required exact string match, rejected valid matches due to OCR noise
2. **Too short flicker grace period** - 125ms meant 4 missed frames would cause creature recreation
3. **No fuzzy name matching** - Single character difference (OCR error) would cause complete rejection

### Example of the Problem:
```
Frame 1: "Troll" detected, instanceId = 100
Frame 2: OCR reads "Trol" (missing 'l'), name mismatch, health bar rejected
Frame 3: Health bar lost, enters 125ms grace period
Frame 4-8: Grace period expires (5 frames later)
Frame 9: Health bar re-detected, creates NEW creature "Troll", instanceId = 101
```

**Result:** Targeting worker sees instance ID change (100 → 101), thinks target died, switches to new target.

---

## Solution Implemented

### **Fix 1: Increased Flicker Grace Periods**

**File:** `electron/workers/creatureMonitor.js:74-75`

```javascript
// BEFORE:
const CREATURE_FLICKER_GRACE_PERIOD_MS = 125;
const STATIONARY_CREATURE_GRACE_PERIOD_MS = 300;

// AFTER:
const CREATURE_FLICKER_GRACE_PERIOD_MS = 250; // 2x longer
const STATIONARY_CREATURE_GRACE_PERIOD_MS = 500; // 1.67x longer
```

**Why:**
- **250ms** = ~8 frames at 30 FPS (was only 4 frames)
- **500ms** for adjacent/stationary creatures (they're more likely to be combat targets)
- Gives more time for temporary health bar detection failures to recover

**Impact:**
- Creatures survive brief health bar detection failures
- Instance IDs stay stable even with intermittent detection

---

### **Fix 2: Added Fuzzy Name Matching**

**File:** `electron/workers/creatureMonitor.js:119-140`

Added `isSimilarName()` helper function:

```javascript
function isSimilarName(name1, name2) {
  if (!name1 || !name2) return false;
  if (name1 === name2) return true;
  
  // Normalize: trim and lowercase
  const n1 = name1.trim().toLowerCase();
  const n2 = name2.trim().toLowerCase();
  if (n1 === n2) return true;
  
  // Check if one is substring of other (handles truncation)
  if (n1.includes(n2) || n2.includes(n1)) return true;
  
  // Check if names start the same way (OCR might miss last chars)
  const minLen = Math.min(n1.length, n2.length);
  if (minLen >= 4) { // At least 4 characters
    const prefix1 = n1.substring(0, minLen - 1);
    const prefix2 = n2.substring(0, minLen - 1);
    if (prefix1 === prefix2) return true;
  }
  
  return false;
}
```

**How it works:**
1. **Exact match** - "Troll" === "Troll" ✅
2. **Case-insensitive** - "Troll" === "troll" ✅
3. **Substring** - "Troll" includes "Trol" ✅
4. **Prefix match** - "Troll" and "Trolle" share prefix "Trol" ✅

**Examples:**
```javascript
isSimilarName("Troll", "Trol")        → true  (substring)
isSimilarName("Dragon", "Drago")      → true  (prefix match)
isSimilarName("Demon", "demon")       → true  (case-insensitive)
isSimilarName("Rat", "Cave Rat")      → true  (substring)
isSimilarName("Troll", "Dwarf")       → false (completely different)
```

---

### **Fix 3: Relaxed Pre-Check Name Validation**

**File:** `electron/workers/creatureMonitor.js:821`

```javascript
// BEFORE: Strict equality
if (preOcrName && preOcrName !== oldCreature.name) {
  bestMatch = null; // Reject match
}

// AFTER: Fuzzy matching
if (preOcrName && !isSimilarName(preOcrName, oldCreature.name)) {
  bestMatch = null; // Only reject if names are COMPLETELY different
}
```

**Impact:**
- OCR reading "Trol" instead of "Troll" → Health bar still matched ✅
- OCR reading "Dragon" instead of "Troll" → Health bar rejected ✅ (correct behavior)

---

## Behavior Changes

### Before Fix

```
Timeline:
0ms:   Troll detected, instanceId = 100, targeting engages
50ms:  OCR reads "Trol", exact match fails, health bar rejected
51ms:  Grace period starts (125ms)
176ms: Grace period expires, creature deleted
177ms: Health bar re-detected as "Troll", NEW instanceId = 101
178ms: Targeting sees instance 100 disappeared, transitions to SELECTING
179ms: Targeting selects instance 101 (same Troll!)
```

**User sees:** Random target switching between identical creatures

---

### After Fix

```
Timeline:
0ms:   Troll detected, instanceId = 100, targeting engages
50ms:  OCR reads "Trol", fuzzy match succeeds ("Trol" similar to "Troll")
51ms:  Health bar matched to existing creature 100
52ms:  Instance ID stays 100
...
500ms: Still attacking same Troll with instanceId = 100
```

**User sees:** Stable targeting, no random switching

---

## Combined Effect with Targeting Fixes

These creature monitor fixes work together with the targeting hysteresis fixes:

### **Layer 1: Creature Monitor (This Fix)**
- Prevents instance ID changes for the same creature
- Keeps creature tracking stable despite OCR errors

### **Layer 2: Targeting Hysteresis (Previous Fix)**
- Prevents switching when scores are similar
- Requires significant priority difference to preempt

**Result:** Rock-solid target stability from both ends!

---

## Edge Cases Handled

### **1. Legitimate Name Changes**
```javascript
// Creature evolves or transforms
Old: "Rat"
New: "Cave Rat"

// isSimilarName("Rat", "Cave Rat") → true (substring match)
// Health bar stays matched ✅
```

**Note:** This is intentional - we prefer stable instance IDs over detecting "different" creatures with similar names.

### **2. Completely Different Creatures**
```javascript
// Troll dies, Demon takes its place
Old: "Troll"
New: "Demon"

// isSimilarName("Troll", "Demon") → false
// Health bar rejected, new creature created ✅
```

### **3. Truncated Battle List Names**
```javascript
// Battle list shows: "Ancient Scar..."
// OCR reads: "Ancient Scarab"

// isSimilarName("Ancient Scar", "Ancient Scarab") → true (prefix)
// Match succeeds ✅
```

### **4. Case Sensitivity**
```javascript
// OCR sometimes reads different case
// isSimilarName("Troll", "TROLL") → true
// isSimilarName("Troll", "troll") → true
```

---

## Performance Impact

**Negligible:**
- `isSimilarName()` only runs when pre-check OCR happens (not every frame)
- Simple string operations (substring, includes, toLowerCase)
- No regex, no complex algorithms
- Added ~30 lines of code

**Grace period increase:**
- No performance impact (just a longer timer)
- May slightly increase memory (creatures stay in activeCreatures longer)
- Trade-off: Stability > Memory (worth it)

---

## Testing Checklist

When testing, verify:
- [ ] Target stays locked during combat (no random switches)
- [ ] Instance IDs remain stable when fighting same creature
- [ ] Different creatures still get different instance IDs
- [ ] OCR errors don't cause creature recreation
- [ ] Battle list truncated names still work
- [ ] No memory leaks (creatures eventually get cleaned up)

---

## Configuration

If issues arise, these values can be tuned:

### Grace Periods
**File:** `creatureMonitor.js:74-75`

```javascript
const CREATURE_FLICKER_GRACE_PERIOD_MS = 250; // Increase for more stability
const STATIONARY_CREATURE_GRACE_PERIOD_MS = 500; // Increase for combat targets
```

**Recommendations:**
- **Increase** if still seeing instance ID changes
- **Decrease** if creatures stay tracked after they die
- Typical range: 200-500ms

### Name Similarity
**File:** `creatureMonitor.js:119-140`

The `isSimilarName()` function can be adjusted:

```javascript
// Current: Requires 4+ chars for prefix match
if (minLen >= 4) {

// Stricter: Require 6+ chars
if (minLen >= 6) {

// Looser: Allow 3+ chars
if (minLen >= 3) {
```

---

## Known Limitations

### **1. Name Similarity Can Over-Match**
If two creatures have very similar names (e.g., "Rat" and "Cave Rat"), they might be tracked as the same creature.

**Mitigation:** The position-based matching (before name check) prevents this in practice - creatures at different screen positions won't match.

### **2. Longer Grace Period = Slightly Slower Cleanup**
Dead creatures stay in memory for an extra 125ms (250ms vs 125ms).

**Impact:** Negligible - activeCreatures map typically has <50 entries.
