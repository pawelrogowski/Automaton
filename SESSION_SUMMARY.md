# Session Summary: Phase 2 Worker Refactors

## Date: 2025-10-08

## Objective
Continue implementation of unified SAB state management system by refactoring individual workers to use the new API.

## Completed Work

### 1. ‚úÖ Refactored minimapMonitor (Position Authority)

**Files Modified:**
- `electron/workers/minimap/processing.js`
- `electron/workers/minimap/core.js`

**Changes:**
- Initialized unified SAB interface using `createWorkerInterface()`
- Modified position write to use `sabInterface.set('playerPos', {x, y, z})`
- Removed control channel broadcasts (workers read directly from SAB)
- Maintained legacy SAB and Redux updates during transition period

**Result:** minimapMonitor now writes player position to unified SAB as the single source of truth.

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Refactored pathfinder (Snapshot Reads)

**Files Modified:**
- `electron/workers/pathfinder/core.js`
- `electron/workers/pathfinder/logic.js`

**Changes:**
- Initialized unified SAB interface in worker startup
- Implemented snapshot reads: `sabInterface.snapshot(['playerPos'])` for consistent data
- Added fallback to Redux state if SAB read fails (graceful degradation)
- Updated all `playerMinimapPosition` references to use `playerPos` from snapshot
- Fixed scope issue: moved `pathTargetCoords` calculation outside `pathDataArray` block
- Writes computed path to unified SAB: `sabInterface.set('pathData', ...)`
- Removed control channel broadcasts

**Result:** pathfinder reads position from SAB with version consistency and writes paths to SAB.

## Critical Issue Discovered & Resolved

### Problem: Control Channel Buffer Overflow

During live testing with character movement, we encountered:
```
[ControlChannel] Buffer full, dropping message
```

**Root Cause:**
- minimapMonitor was broadcasting `POSITION_UPDATED` on every tile move
- pathfinder was broadcasting `PATH_READY` frequently
- Control channel ring buffer holds only 32 messages
- **Nobody was consuming the messages** ‚Üí buffer filled up instantly

**Solution:**
Workers now read data **directly from SAB** when needed instead of relying on broadcasts:
- Position updates: Workers call `sabInterface.get('playerPos')` when they need it
- Path updates: Workers call `sabInterface.get('pathData')` when they need it

**Control channel reserved for:**
- Critical coordination events (handovers between cavebot ‚Üî targeting)
- State transitions that require acknowledgment
- Infrequent but important notifications

---

## Architecture Pattern Established

### ‚úÖ Data Flow Pattern (Confirmed Working)

```
Writer Worker:
  1. Detect change (e.g., player moved)
  2. Write to SAB: sabInterface.set('property', value)
  3. (Optional) Update legacy systems during transition

Reader Worker:
  1. When needed, read from SAB: sabInterface.get('property')
  2. OR use snapshot for consistency: sabInterface.snapshot(['prop1', 'prop2'])
```

### ‚ùå Anti-Pattern (Causes Buffer Overflow)

```
Writer Worker:
  1. Detect change
  2. Write to SAB
  3. Broadcast message ‚Üê DON'T DO THIS FOR HIGH-FREQUENCY DATA
```

## Testing Results

### ‚úÖ Application Startup
- All workers initialize successfully
- Unified SAB interface created in minimapMonitor: ‚úÖ
- Unified SAB interface created in pathfinder: ‚úÖ
- No import errors: ‚úÖ

### ‚úÖ Runtime Testing (Character Movement)
- Position detection and SAB write: ‚úÖ
- No buffer overflow errors after fix: ‚úÖ
- Pathfinding calculations running: ‚úÖ
- Legacy systems still receiving updates: ‚úÖ

## Next Steps (Remaining Work)

### High Priority
1. **Refactor creatureMonitor** (complex, high performance impact)
   - Batch writes for creatures + battleList + target
   - Implement OCR cache with position-based invalidation
   - Dirty region tracking

2. **Refactor cavebot** (critical for handover system)
   - Read position and path from SAB
   - Implement control channel handover to targeting
   - Remove Redux state dependencies

3. **Refactor targeting** (critical for handover system)
   - Read battleList and target from SAB
   - Listen for handover messages on control channel
   - Send handover back to cavebot when combat ends

### Medium Priority
4. Create `movementUtils` shared module
5. Update other workers (screenMonitor, luaScriptWorker)
6. Add performance monitoring (metrics.js)
7. Add validation and error detection

### Low Priority
8. Remove old SAB management code
9. Update documentation (WARP.md)

---

## Performance Impact (Estimated)

### Current Implementation
- ‚úÖ Config updates (Redux ‚Üí SAB): **<1ms** (immediate)
- ‚úÖ Position reads from SAB: **<0.1ms** (lock-free atomic)
- ‚úÖ Path writes to SAB: **<0.5ms** (includes 10 waypoints)
- ‚úÖ No control channel overhead for high-frequency data

### Expected After Full Refactor
- Control handover latency: **15-20ms** (vs 200-250ms currently)
- Position ‚Üí path ‚Üí movement: **5-10ms** (consistent snapshots)
- Redux dispatches: **~10 messages/sec** (vs 100-200 currently, 95% reduction)

---

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Control Channel is NOT a Message Queue
The control channel is a **coordination mechanism**, not a data distribution system. High-frequency data should be read directly from SAB.

### 2. Broadcast Sparingly
Only broadcast when:
- The event is rare (handovers, mode switches)
- Immediate notification is critical
- Multiple workers need to react synchronously

### 3. Pull > Push for High-Frequency Data
Workers pulling data from SAB when needed scales better than pushing updates to all workers.

### 4. Graceful Degradation Works
The fallback pattern (try SAB, fall back to Redux) ensures no disruption during refactor.

---

## Code Quality

### ‚úÖ Maintained
- Consistent arrow function syntax
- Concise comments
- camelCase naming
- Error handling with try-catch
- Logging for debugging

### üîÑ In Progress
- Removing legacy code (will happen after all workers refactored)
- Adding comprehensive JSDoc
- Performance metrics collection

---

## Summary

**Phase 2 Progress: 2 of ~8 workers refactored (25%)**

We successfully refactored two critical workers (minimapMonitor and pathfinder) to use the unified SAB system. Both workers now:
- Initialize the SAB interface correctly
- Read/write data atomically with version control
- Avoid control channel overflow by reading directly from SAB
- Maintain backward compatibility with legacy systems

The established patterns are working well and ready to be applied to remaining workers. The next session should focus on creatureMonitor (complex but high impact) followed by cavebot and targeting (critical for control handover testing).
