1.limit number of possible waypoints in a section to 1000:
    - relevant parts are redux state, react components(minimap, waypoint table)
    - handle the buttons in minimap if number is already 1000 so they display limit reached
      instead of allowing for creation of more waypoint

2. standarize special areas:
    - special area avoidance parameter should reflect number of moves required to avoid it.
        - for example:
            - special area avoidance 0 would mean no avoidance, we can omit even passing it to pathfinder.
            - avoidance of 1 would mean stepping on it would cost  additional 1 move for the sake of pathfinder algorithm.
            - avoidance of 100 would mean stepping on it would cost additional 100 moves
            - to allow for total avoidance passing 255 would tottaly make tile unwalkable
            - all creature positions passed to pathfinder should be treated as special special areas:
                - it should allow for walking through creature tiles only if no other path is available.

3. Improve pathfinder and targetingWorker as well as pathfinder native module for finding best route to avoid creatures while running away:
    - the distance param we use to keep away, fe. 4 should mean that we want to keep 4 tiles chebyshev distance between us and the creature.
    - when chosing a path all visible creatures should be considered:
        - this means chosing path that would simultainously attempt to keep set distance from current target creature
        as well as avoiding running towards any other existing creatures, essentially avoiding all creatures at once.
    - reduce the 'bounce effect' where targeting changes targets too often and it produces unpredictable paths that are unproductive. 


4. Change the Targeting page controlls and targetingWorker logic to allow for more granural controlls.
    - implement targeting list where user would input names of creatures to consider as targets:
        - each creature should have it own stance: "Reach","Keep Away","Ignore" and possible more in the future.
        - each creature should have it's own distance parameter.
        - the targeting worker should now mark the targeted creature with rightClick in the gameWorld using its absolute coordinates window:
            - to avoid misclicks it should rightClick only immidiately after creature absolute coordinate update.
            - the mouse controll module is used in luaApi, we just need to adapt it to targetingWorker.

5. limit the total distance in pathfinder native module to 255 moves.

6. Improve the special area controlls:
    - allow for new mode parameter for special areas "mode" it would be "fill","border" with "fill" being default and just the way it works now:
        - if special area has width or height of 1 or 2 then it would not matter.
        - if special area has width or height bigger than 2 and it's to "border" then only border tiles of special area should be considered for avoidance
        while the center should not have any avoidance - this would allow for creating "box" special areas .
        - update the waypointTable and minimap components:
            - to have additional mode field in waypointTable.
            - to have additional resize option in special area menu:
                - when clicked it should allow for resizing the special area with cursor on the minimap - left click should finilize the resize.
