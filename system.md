Our Electron application employs a sophisticated multi-worker architecture to capture, process, and act upon real-time visual data. The visual input stream is initiated by `@/electron/workers/captureWorker.js` and managed by `@/electron/workerManager.js`, which orchestrates data distribution to various specialized processing units. These include `@/electron/workers/regionMonitor.js` for identifying specific screen areas, `@/electron/workers/ocrWorker.js` (supported by `@/electron/workers/ocrWorker/parsers.js`) for text recognition, and `@/electron/workers/minimapMonitor.js` for contextual navigation data. Automation logic is powered by a robust Lua scripting environment, leveraging `@/electron/workers/luaApi.js`, `@/electron/workers/luaScriptWorker.js`, and `@/electron/workers/cavebotLuaExecutor.js`. This integrates with `@/electron/workers/pathfinderWorker.js` and `@/electron/workers/cavebotWorker.js` to execute complex in-application actions. An existing `@/electron/workers/screenMonitor/ruleProcessor.js` also contributes to the visual analysis pipeline. This intricate system translates raw visual input into actionable insights and automated responses. State management across this distributed architecture is handled via Redux, maintaining two distinct but synchronized stores: `@/electron/store.js` in the main process and `@/frontend/redux/store.js` in the renderer process. This setup utilizes shared slices from `@/frontend/redux/slices`, with actions dispatched between processes to ensure a consistent state. A core principle is the strict adherence to pure reducers, guaranteeing deterministic state transitions and reproducibility across both processes. While the system is largely functional, it is under continuous development, with ongoing feature additions and refactoring efforts. For all future development, including new features and architectural refinements, paramount importance is placed on memory safety to prevent leaks and ensure stability in long-running processes, maintainability to ensure the system remains understandable and extensible, performance for real-time responsiveness, and developer experience to facilitate efficient contributions and onboarding.
