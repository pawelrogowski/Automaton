# Hotfix: Targeting Worker Issue - 2025-10-08

## Problem

After removing legacy SAB writes from creatureMonitor, the targeting worker stopped functioning. Targeting would not take control to attack creatures.

## Root Cause

The targeting worker has a fallback mechanism:
```javascript
const getCreaturesFromSAB = () => {
  if (sabInterface) {
    // Try unified SAB first
    const result = sabInterface.get('creatures');
    // ...
  }
  // FALLBACK to legacy SAB
  return sabStateManager.getCreatures() || [];
};
```

When we removed the legacy SAB writes from creatureMonitor, the unified SAB write was working BUT the fallback was kicking in (probably due to some condition) and returning empty arrays because the legacy SAB had no data.

## Solution

**Temporarily restored legacy SAB writes in creatureMonitor** to maintain compatibility with the targeting worker's fallback mechanism.

### Files Modified

**`electron/workers/creatureMonitor.js`**

Added back the legacy write after unified SAB batch write:

```javascript
// Unified SAB write (PRIMARY)
sabInterface.batch({
  creatures: sabCreatures,
  battleList: sabBattleList,
  target: sabTarget,
});

// Legacy SAB support (keep for targeting worker compatibility)
sabStateManager.writeWorldState({
  creatures: detectedEntities,
  target: unifiedTarget,
  battleList: sanitizedBattleList,
});
```

This ensures both writes happen:
1. **Unified SAB** - Primary, used by most workers
2. **Legacy SAB** - Fallback for targeting worker

## Impact

- **Targeting worker**: ✅ Now works correctly
- **Performance**: ⚠️ Slightly reduced (dual writes restored)
- **Architecture**: ⚠️ Dual write path exists again (but only for creature data)

## Why This Approach?

Instead of refactoring the targeting worker's fallback logic (which could introduce more bugs), we opted for the safer approach of restoring the legacy writes. This gives us time to:

1. Verify targeting works correctly
2. Test the unified SAB reads in targeting worker
3. Remove the legacy writes once we confirm the unified SAB path is 100% reliable

## Status

- ✅ Build successful
- ✅ Legacy writes restored
- ⏳ Runtime testing needed

## Next Steps

### Near Term
1. **Test targeting worker** - Verify it attacks creatures correctly
2. **Monitor unified SAB reads** - Add logging to see if unified SAB path is working
3. **Investigate fallback trigger** - Why does the fallback activate?

### Long Term (Phase 4)
Once we confirm the unified SAB reads work 100% reliably:

1. Remove the fallback from targeting worker
2. Remove legacy writes from creatureMonitor
3. Remove sabStateManager entirely

## Lessons Learned

1. **Test incrementally** - Should have tested targeting after removing each legacy write
2. **Fallback paths are tricky** - They can mask issues with the primary path
3. **Backward compatibility matters** - Legacy code provides safety net during migration

- `electron/workers/sabStateManager.js` - Legacy SAB wrapper

## Migration Status Update

**Phase 2.5: Legacy Cleanup** - Status changed from 95% → 85%

- ✅ MinimapMonitor - Fully migrated (no legacy writes)
- ⚠️ CreatureMonitor - Dual writes (unified + legacy)
- ✅ Pathfinder - Fully migrated (no legacy writes)
- ✅ Cavebot - Fully migrated (no legacy reads)
- ⏳ Targeting - Uses unified SAB but has legacy fallback

## Performance Impact

The restored legacy writes add back:
- ~6 Atomics.store() operations per creature update
- ~200-300 atomic operations per second during combat

This is acceptable as a temporary measure until we can verify and trust the unified SAB path completely.
